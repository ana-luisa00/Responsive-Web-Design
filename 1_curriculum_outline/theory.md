# HTML
HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It's the code that defines the structure and content of a webpage. 

## Elements
HTML is made up of elements. Elements start with an opening tag (`<h1>`), ends with a closing tag (`</h1>`)
### Headings
```<h1>Welcome to freeCodeCamp</h1>```
An h1 element is the main heading of a webpage and you should only use one per page

h2 elements represent subheadings. You can have multiple per page.
```<h2>This is a subheading.</h2>```

There are six heading elements in HTML: h1 through h6. They're used to show the importance of sections on your webpage, with h1 being the most important and h6 the least.

### Paragraph
When you need to add a paragraph to a webpage, you can use the p element.
```<p>This is a paragraph element.</p>```

# CSS
While HTML defines the structure and content of a webpage, CSS is used to add style — things like colors, fonts, spacing, and layout.

# JavaScript
Finally, JavaScript makes your webpage interactive — it lets you tell the page what to do when someone clicks a button, submits a form, or many other things.
